      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jitender (Jee-thoo) S. Thakur â€” aka JST. Iâ€™m an endlessly curious mind exploring the intersection of data, AI, and the human experience. With over a decade in data-driven roles and a deep passion for storytelling through data, Iâ€™m now focused on staying at the forefront of intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and communicate. Before diving into the data world, I spent a decade in automotive engineering and entrepreneurship â€” experiences that continue to shape how I think, build, and explore.</p>
      <p>This site will soon showcase my journey as a lifelong learner and professional â€” and Iâ€™m excited to connect, collaborate, and grow with like-minded people.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, feel free to reach out: <a href="mailto:jitender.s.thakur@gmail.com">jitender.s.thakur@gmail.com</a></p>
